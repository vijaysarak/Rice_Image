CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network. It is a deep learning algorithm that is commonly used for analyzing visual data, such as images or videos. CNNs are specifically designed to process data with a grid-like structure, where the input is typically represented as a 2D matrix. The main idea behind CNNs is to apply a series of filters, known as convolutional layers, to the input data. These filters are designed to detect various features or patterns within the data, such as edges, corners, or textures. By stacking multiple convolutional layers, the network can learn increasingly complex features. The convolutional layers are typically followed by pooling layers, which reduce the spatial dimensions of the data and help extract the most salient information. Pooling layers aggregate the output of nearby neurons and downsample the data, reducing its dimensionality while preserving important features.

# Result :
In this study, Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag, which are five different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey, were used. A total of 75,000 grain images, 15,000 from each of these varieties, are included in the dataset. Models were created by using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for the image dataset, and classification processes were performed. Statistical results of sensitivity, specificity, prediction, F1 score, accuracy, false positive rate and false negative rate were calculated using the confusion matrix values of the models and the results of each model were given in tables. Classification successes from the models were achieved as 99% for CNN.
